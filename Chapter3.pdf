CHAPTER 2: WEBSITE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS
Group A: Short Questions
1. Define the term "Sitemap" in the planning phase
A sitemap is a structured representation of a website's navigation hierarchy and organizational structure, typically created during the planning phase of web development. It visually or hierarchically documents all pages and sections of the website, showing how different pages relate to one another and how users navigate through the site. Sitemaps serve multiple purposes: they facilitate communication between stakeholders, guide developers during implementation, and provide search engines with an overview of site structure for optimal indexing[1].
2. What is the purpose of the "Launch" phase in web development?
The Launch phase marks the transition of a completed website from the development environment to the live production environment where it becomes publicly accessible. During this phase, developers deploy the website to web servers, configure domain names and DNS settings, perform final validation tests in the production environment, and announce the website to the target audience. The Launch phase also involves monitoring for technical issues and preparing support systems for managing user inquiries[1][2].
3. Why is "Documentation" important in the development lifecycle?
Documentation serves critical functions throughout the website development lifecycle. Technical documentation records system architecture, code structure, APIs, and functionality, facilitating maintenance and updates by current and future developers. User documentation provides guidelines for site administrators and content managers. Documentation reduces knowledge dependency on individual developers, improves code maintainability, enables faster onboarding of new team members, and provides reference material for troubleshooting issues. Comprehensive documentation is essential for long-term project sustainability and quality assurance[1].
4. Differentiate between Front-end and Back-end development
Front-end development focuses on the user interface and user experience layers of a website. Front-end developers work with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create interactive, visually appealing interfaces that users directly interact with through their browsers. Front-end technologies determine how information is presented, how users navigate the site, and how responsive and performant the interface is[1].
Back-end development involves server-side logic, database management, and application programming interfaces (APIs) that power the website's functionality. Back-end developers use languages such as Python, PHP, Java, or Node.js to process user requests, manage data, authenticate users, and generate dynamic content. While front-end development focuses on presentation, back-end development ensures the website functions correctly and securely manages data[1][2].
Group B: Long Questions
5. "Planning is the most critical phase of web development." Discuss this statement by listing the key activities performed during the planning phase
This statement is accurate because the planning phase establishes the foundation for all subsequent development activities. Inadequate planning frequently results in project delays, budget overruns, and requirement mismatches[1].
Key activities in the planning phase include:
•	Requirements Analysis: Gathering comprehensive functional and non-functional requirements from stakeholders
•	Target Audience Definition: Identifying and understanding the intended users, their needs, preferences, and behavior
•	Goal Setting: Establishing clear, measurable objectives for the website
•	Scope Definition: Clearly delineating what will and will not be included in the project
•	Feasibility Analysis: Assessing technical, financial, and temporal feasibility
•	Resource Planning: Identifying necessary personnel, tools, infrastructure, and budgets
•	Timeline Development: Creating project schedules with realistic milestones and deadlines
•	Sitemap Creation: Structuring the website's information architecture
•	Competitive Analysis: Researching competitor websites and industry best practices
•	Risk Assessment: Identifying potential challenges and mitigation strategies
Effective planning minimizes rework, reduces development costs, ensures stakeholder alignment, and increases the likelihood of project success[2].
6. Explain the iterative nature of the Maintenance phase. Why is a website never truly "finished"?
The Maintenance phase operates iteratively because websites exist in dynamic environments where business requirements, technology standards, user expectations, and competitive landscapes continuously evolve. Maintenance is not a one-time activity but an ongoing process spanning the entire operational lifetime of the website[1][2].
Reasons websites are never truly "finished":
•	Technology Evolution: New browsers, devices, frameworks, and security standards emerge regularly, requiring updates
•	User Feedback: Collected user data and feedback reveal usability issues and desired features
•	Performance Optimization: Monitoring reveals opportunities to improve speed, accessibility, and functionality
•	Security Updates: Vulnerabilities must be patched, and security protocols must be updated
•	Content Updates: Information becomes outdated and requires regular refreshing
•	Competitive Pressure: Competitors introduce new features, necessitating comparable improvements
•	Changing Business Needs: Organizational goals and strategies evolve, requiring website adaptations
This iterative cycle of monitoring, analyzing, updating, and testing continues indefinitely, making web maintenance a perpetual commitment[1][2].
7. Describe the process of "Information Gathering." Why is understanding the target audience crucial during this step?
Information gathering is a comprehensive process of collecting data about the website's purpose, stakeholders, users, technical requirements, and business objectives. This phase involves conducting interviews with stakeholders and potential users, analyzing competitor websites, researching industry trends, surveying target demographics, and documenting findings comprehensively[1].
Understanding the target audience is crucial because:
•	User-Centered Design: Knowledge of user demographics, preferences, and behaviors enables designing interfaces that align with user expectations and mental models
•	Content Strategy: Understanding audience education levels, interests, and information needs guides content creation decisions
•	Technology Choices: Target audience demographics inform decisions about browser support, mobile optimization, and accessibility requirements
•	Feature Prioritization: User needs determine which features are most valuable and should receive development resources
•	Engagement and Conversion: Tailored experiences based on audience understanding improve engagement metrics and conversion rates
•	Reducing Risk: User research minimizes the risk of developing features users don't need or in ways they don't expect
Skipping audience analysis frequently results in websites that fail to meet user needs and achieve poor adoption rates[2].
Group C: Scenario-Based Questions
8. You are the project manager for a new e-commerce site. The client wants to skip the "Testing" phase to save money and launch early. Write a persuasive argument explaining the potential risks of skipping this phase
Skipping the Testing phase would be strategically inadvisable and likely to result in substantially greater costs and reputational damage. I would present the following risks to your client:
Security Risks: Without comprehensive security testing, the website remains vulnerable to attacks such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and unauthorized data access. For an e-commerce site handling payment information and personal data, security breaches could expose sensitive customer information, incur substantial legal liabilities, and violate compliance regulations such as PCI-DSS[1][2].
Functionality Risks: Untested features may malfunction in production environments, causing transaction failures, inventory discrepancies, or incorrect billing. These failures directly damage customer trust and revenue.
Compatibility Risks: Without cross-browser and cross-device testing, the site may function poorly on certain browsers, operating systems, or mobile devices, excluding entire segments of the target audience[1].
Financial Consequences: The costs of fixing bugs discovered by users in production substantially exceed the costs of fixing them during testing. Customer complaints, refunds, and damage control consume far more resources than comprehensive pre-launch testing. Industry estimates suggest production bug fixes cost five to ten times more than development-phase fixes[2].
The short-term cost savings of skipping testing are illusory compared to long-term costs, customer dissatisfaction, and reputational damage. A delayed but thoroughly tested launch is far preferable to an early but problematic launch.
9. A developer begins coding a website immediately after meeting the client, without creating a design prototype or sitemap. Midway through, the client rejects the layout. Analyze what went wrong in the process and how it should have been handled
What Went Wrong:
The developer skipped critical planning phases (requirements documentation, design prototyping, and stakeholder approval) and proceeded directly to implementation. This violated fundamental project management principles and resulted in:
•	Misaligned Expectations: Without documented requirements and design prototypes for client review, the developer made assumptions about design preferences, resulting in a final product diverging from client expectations[1]
•	Wasted Development Time: Rework is substantially more expensive than getting it right initially
•	Poor Communication: The client had no opportunity to provide early feedback before substantial resources were invested
•	Scope Creep: Without documented requirements, changes become contentious and expensive[2]
How It Should Have Been Handled:
1.	Detailed Requirement Gathering: Document functional requirements, design preferences, target audience characteristics, and success metrics
2.	Information Architecture: Create a sitemap showing the site's structure and navigation hierarchy
3.	Design Prototyping: Develop wireframes or mockups for client review, allowing feedback before development begins
4.	Stakeholder Approval: Obtain written approval of designs before commencing full development
5.	Iterative Design Reviews: Conduct regular design reviews during development to catch misalignments early
6.	Change Management Process: Establish a formal process for managing changes and their associated costs
This approach prevents costly rework and ensures client satisfaction[1][2].
10. A university website was launched successfully, but after six months, students stopped visiting it because the exam schedules were outdated. Which phase of the development lifecycle was neglected? Explain the activities involved in this phase
The Maintenance phase was clearly neglected. The university failed to implement ongoing monitoring and content management processes essential for website success[1].
Activities involved in the Maintenance phase:
•	Monitoring and Analytics: Regularly reviewing user behavior, traffic patterns, and engagement metrics to identify issues
•	Content Updates: Systematically refreshing outdated information, news, and schedules
•	Performance Monitoring: Tracking website speed, uptime, and technical performance
•	User Feedback Management: Collecting and analyzing user feedback to identify needed improvements
•	Security Patching: Implementing security updates and vulnerability fixes
•	Compatibility Testing: Ensuring continued compatibility with new browsers and devices
•	Backup and Recovery: Maintaining regular backups and disaster recovery procedures
•	User Support: Providing technical support and addressing user inquiries
•	Periodic Audits: Conducting comprehensive audits of functionality, accessibility, and content accuracy[2]
Without dedicated maintenance processes, websites deteriorate, content becomes stale, and users lose confidence. Organizations must allocate resources for ongoing maintenance to ensure websites continue delivering value
